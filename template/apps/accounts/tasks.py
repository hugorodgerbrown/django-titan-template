"""Background tasks for accounts: the sign-in email.

Views enqueue; they never send mail themselves, so a slow mail server
can't hold a request (settings.TASKS chooses where the task runs: on a
thread of its own, apps.core.task_backends.ThreadBackend).

The address is only this task's argument, so with the thread backend it
stays in memory. A queue-backed backend would store it until the email is
sent, and the privacy notice would have to say so.
