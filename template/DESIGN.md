# DESIGN.md — the Titan design rules

Every Titan app has its own design system, kept in its own repository. This
file is the part they share: the rules every one of those design systems
follows. It comes from the
[django-titan-template](https://github.com/hugorodgerbrown/django-titan-template);
change it there, not here, so `copier update` keeps every app on the same
rules. `tests/test_design.py` and `tests/design/` check each rule they can,
and fail the build when one is broken.

## 1. There is a design system, and it is in the code

An app's design system is three things, all in its repository:

- **Tokens**: the custom properties on `:root` in `static/css/app.css`.
  Every colour, font size, space, corner and shadow the app uses is one.
- **Components**: the classes below the tokens in the same file, built only
  from tokens. One stylesheet, no build step.
- **The design page** at `/app/design/` (`apps/design`, staff only): every
  token, read from the stylesheet, and every component in each of its
  states, drawn by the real CSS.

The design page is the reference. A screenshot, a mockup or this file is
not: where they disagree with the page, the page is right.

## 2. Consult it on every UI change

Before changing anything people see:

1. Open the design page and find the component that already does the job.
   Use it as it is.
2. If none does, change or add a component on the design page first, then
   use it in the screen.
3. A pull request that changes the UI shows a screenshot of the screen and,
   if a component changed, of the design page.

A one-off style in a screen (a new colour, a nudge of 3px, a class used
once) is the thing to avoid. Make it a component or a token, or do without.

## 3. Keep it in sync with the code

- The page reads its tokens from `app.css`, so they can't drift.
- Every component class, and every modifier (`--state`), is shown on the
  design page. A component that can't be (the page frame, the launch
  screen) is listed in `apps/design/conf.py` with the reason.
- The page uses only classes that exist in `app.css`.

A change that adds a component, a state or a token adds it to the page in
the same pull request.

## 4. Use tokens; hard-code nothing

Outside `:root`, `app.css` names no raw values for these:

| What | Written as | Not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Colour | `var(--accent)` | `#2563eb`, `rgba(…)`, `white` |
| Font size | `var(--type-sm)` | `13px`, `0.8125rem` |
| Margin, padding, gap | `var(--space-md)` | `12px`, `0.75rem` |
| Corner | `var(--radius-card)` | `12px`, `50%` |
| Soft shadow | `var(--shadow-float)` | `0 1px 4px rgba(…)` |

Allowed as written: `0`, `auto`, `inherit`, `transparent`, `currentColor`,
`env(…)`, border widths, and a ring drawn as a shadow with no offset or
blur (`inset 0 0 0 2px var(--accent)`). Sizes of things (a 44px button, a
28px spinner) are not spacing and may be literal.

Also:

- **A tint is a token.** A paler or see-through colour (`--accent-soft`) is
  declared once on `:root`, not mixed in a component.
- **Icons take their colour from the text.** An inline SVG uses
  `currentColor`. An SVG in a data URI may only be a `mask-image`, painted
  with a token background.
- **Scripts and templates hold no colours.** A script that needs one reads
  the token with `getComputedStyle`. Emails are the exception: mail clients
  don't read the stylesheet, so they inline their colours.
- **Dark mode redefines tokens, never components.**

## 5. Keep the system small

| Family | Name | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Colours | any name | 20 |
| Font sizes | `--type-*` | 8 |
| Spacing | `--space-*` | the shared scale below |
| Corners | `--radius-*` | 5 |
| Soft shadows | `--shadow-*` | 4 |

Spacing is one 4px scale for every app. An app declares the steps it uses,
by these names and values, and no others:

| Token | `--space-2xs` | `--space-xs` | `--space-sm` | `--space-md` | `--space-lg` | `--space-xl` | `--space-2xl` | `--space-3xl` | `--space-4xl` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Value | 2px | 4px | 8px | 12px | 16px | 20px | 24px | 32px | 48px |

Reaching a limit means two tokens are doing one job. Merge them rather than
raising the limit; a limit changes here, for every app, or not at all.

## 6. Prune

- **No dead CSS.** Every class in `app.css` is put on an element by a
  template, a script or Python. A class built from a prefix
  (`chip--{{ kind }}`) counts for every class with that prefix. The
  design page doesn't count: it shows everything. A class a framework adds
  (Django's `errorlist`) is listed in `apps/design/conf.py`.
- **No dead tokens.** Every token is read by the CSS or a script.
- Delete a component's CSS in the same change that removes its last use.

## 7. Accessible by default

- Text tokens keep a contrast of at least 4.5:1 on the backgrounds they
  sit on (3:1 for text 24px and up).
- Anything tapped is at least 44px in its smaller dimension.
- Focus is visible on everything that takes it.
- Colour is never the only signal: a state also changes a shape, an icon
  or a word.

## 8. Mobile first

A Titan app is used on a phone, in one hand, more than anywhere else.
Design every screen for that first; a wider screen gets more room, never
more features.

- **The base styles are the phone's.** A wider screen is added with
  `@media (min-width: …)`; nothing is taken away with `max-width`.
- **Nothing hides behind hover.** A phone has none, so anything shown on
  hover is also there, or one tap away, without it. Hover only tints.
- **Fit the screen.** Every page has the viewport meta from
  `_head.html`, and an edge fixed to the screen keeps clear of the notch
  and the home bar with `env(safe-area-inset-*)`.
- Tap targets are 44px (section 7), and the main action on a screen sits
  where a thumb reaches it.

## 9. Design for offline

The signal drops in a lift, a tunnel or on a train. The app (everything
under `/app/`) carries on without it.

- **The shell opens offline.** Every script and stylesheet a page under
  `/app/` loads is precached (`apps/pwa/conf.py: PRECACHE_STATIC`). One
  that only works with the network anyway (passkeys) is listed in
  `apps/design/conf.py: NEEDS_NETWORK` with the reason.
- **Writes never fail for want of a signal.** They go through the outbox:
  saved on the device, shown as waiting, sent when the network is back.
- **Say what's offline.** The page frame has the offline banner. Something
  that can't work offline says so where it is, rather than failing
  silently or spinning.
- **Nothing a page needs comes from another origin.** No third-party
  fonts, scripts or stylesheets: they wouldn't be there offline, and the
  CSP blocks them. Analytics are the one exception, and a page works
  without them.

## 10. Every page has the same frame

- **The mark top left goes home.** The first link in the header is the
  app's mark (its icon and name), on every page, and it goes home: to the
  front page (`/`) on the public pages, and to the app's start page (the
  manifest's `start_url`) inside `/app/`, where leaving the app's scope
  would open a browser.
- **Every site has a proper footer.** Every page, public or in the app,
  ends with the site footer: the app's name, a copyright line with the
  year and the name (`© 2026 Gondola`), and links to Terms, Privacy and
  Help. It is one include, `templates/includes/_footer.html`, in both
  base templates.
